Today’s tensions
How much is your mood today affecting your view of tomorrow?
Most CEOs highlight their concerns over the world economy. About 78% of India CEOs,
73% of global CEOs and 69% of Asia Pacific CEOs believe that global economic growth will
decline over the next 12 months.
But our survey also indicates that despite the gloomy global outlook, India CEOs are hopeful
about the country’s economic growth: More than five in ten CEOs (57%) express optimism
about India’s economy over the next 12 months. In comparison, only 37% of Asia Pacific
CEOs and 29% of global CEOs expect economic growth to improve in their countries or
regions over the next 12 months.

The priorities for global CEOs are different: 48% stress on cybersecurity and data privacy.
For most Asia Pacific CEOs, the most important action is adjusting markets or exploring new
ones (53%), followed by supply chains (49%), diversifying products or services (48%) and
increasing investments in cybersecurity or data privacy (47%).

PwC’s 2022 Digital Trust Insights Survey11 indicates that India business leaders believe
avoidable and unnecessary organisational complexity poses ‘concerning’ cyber and
privacy risks. A security focus that cuts across the entire business – from top leadership to
every department and across all employees – is key to instilling a culture of cyber security,
managing cyber risks, enhancing communication between boards and management, and
aligning cyber and business strategy.
India CEOs also underscore the need to include the impact of possible disruptions in
scenario planning and corporate operating models. Supply chains, for instance, in the
past have relied on siloed functions, limited data availability, manual decision making and
unconnected planning with limited options for customisation. The supply chain of the future
needs to be:
.customised to cater to specific expectations of service levels/product availability/pack
sizes
.made autonomous using AI and ML technology that can handle daily supply chain
scenarios, while leaders focus only on managing exceptions/extremely critical scenarios
.integrated through a supply chain control tower that would provide an end-to-end
integrated view across plan, source, make and deliver
.powered by data analytics and integrated planning solutions to drive the underlying
processes and optimisation requirements. A positive trend, indicated by a recent PwC
survey, is that India’s manufacturing sector has integrated supply chain planning among
its top priorities for 3–5 years.

Building flexibility in the supply chain is a more appropriate strategy than
aiming for complete resiliency in the first place. The COVID-19 pandemic
and the Russia-Ukraine conflict required Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories to bring
in this flexibility by vigilant day-to-day monitoring of the situation and
by reacting to these developments with agility. This flexibility led us to
attaining resilience in our supply chain.

The next steps
CEOs need to prepare for both anticipated and unanticipated disruptions and security risks
to keep their businesses viable and growing. The need of the hour is to:
.plan scenarios for a wider range of disruptions, and invest in and develop more agile
supply chain strategies powered by data and technology to enable real-time responses
to crises before they occur
.customise to create a network of supply chains that is specifically tailored to customer
needs, and ensure connected dashboards of data, key business metrics, and events
personalised to decision-makers across the supply chain
.build rapid-response tech-savvy teams to handle crises and to ensure they are supported
.simplify the complex cybersecurity ecosystem and prioritise investments in the right
areas
.develop a dedicated leadership group that understands the significance of cybersecurity
and treats it as a priority.
A balanced agenda
How much time and money are you investing in the future?
To effectively navigate the dual challenge of dealing with the present while preparing for the
future, CEOs must perform a balancing act that starts with their own calendars. It appears
that for 26% of India CEOs, driving current operating performance ‘actually’ consumes the
biggest share of their time. Asked how they would ideally allocate their time if they could
start with a blank calendar, 24% of India CEOs say that they would like to spend more time
evolving their business and its strategy to meet future demands and 19%, ideally engaging
with and mentoring/developing employees.

It is also clear from the responses that technology- and reinvention-oriented investments are
a top priority for many CEOs. Around 85% of India respondents are investing in upskilling
their workforce in priority areas, 82% in automating processes and 81% in deploying
technology such as cloud and AI over the next 12 months.
Asked to what extent the different investment areas are needed to preserve their current
business and to reinvent for the future, both global and India CEOs flag investments in
deploying advanced technologies as a priority for reinventing the business for the future.
26th Annual Global CEO Survey: India perspective 21
While upskilling (85%), automating processes (82%) and deploying technology (81%)
are the three top areas where companies are investing, deploying technology (61%) and
decarbonising the company’s business model (59%) are two top priorities for reinventing the
business for the future.
Base: Those respondents who are making an investment in any of these areas in the next 12 months

The power sector has huge growth potential and is poised to move to the
next level with a laser focus on renewable sources and their integration
with digital technologies, including storage, smart grid, smart metering
and other integrated solutions. These can help the country leapfrog
from conventional generation, transmission and distribution to a more
distributed power generation and electricity service model providing
better quality service to consumers.

The next steps
The balancing act facing India CEOs starts with his/her own calendar and extends to most
corporate resource allocation decisions. The CEOs need to:
.invest in upskilling as a lever to address talent shortage and provide training as required
.invest in technology to reinvent the business
.speed up investment in alternative energy sources and decarbonising.
